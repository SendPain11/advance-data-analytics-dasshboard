---

### Option 2: Production Mode (With Pre-trained Models)

**For production-style deployment with saved models**

#### Step 1: Train and Save Models

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will:
- Train all ML models with your data
- Save models to `models/` directory
- Create metadata for model versioning
- Generate performance reports

Output:
```
🚀 Starting model training...
📊 Training Linear_Regression...
   ✅ R² Score: 0.8542
📊 Training Random_Forest...
   ✅ R² Score: 0.9123
📊 Training Gradient_Boosting...
   ✅ R² Score: 0.9087
🏆 Best Model: Random_Forest
💾 Saving models to models/...
   ✅ Saved models/linear_regression_model.pkl
   ✅ Saved models/random_forest_model.pkl
   ✅ Saved models/gradient_boosting_model.pkl
✨ All models saved successfully!
```

#### Step 2: Run Dashboard with Pre-trained Models

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then in the sidebar:
- ☑️ Check "Use Pre-trained Models"
- Dashboard will load models from disk
- Faster predictions (no training needed)

**Perfect for:** Production deployment, scheduled retraining, large datasets

- Trains models once, saves to disk
- Loads pre-trained models in dashboard
- Supports hyperparameter tuning
- Best for: Production, large datasets, scheduled retraining

### Performance Optimization

### Evaluation Metrics

- **R² Score**: Variance explained by model (0-1, higher is better)
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error (lower is better)
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error (lower is better)

## 🔒 Data Privacy & Security

- ✅ No data stored permanently
- ✅ All processing in-memory
- ✅ Sample data uses seeded randomization
- ✅ Uploaded data not logged
- ✅ Models saved only if explicitly trained via `train_model.py`
